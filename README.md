# WALLI: an app to share money

This app is made to share exepenses between friends, family component, roommate or whoever you want. You have to register, then you can create groups and put your friends inside of it. When you're in a group, you can put all the expenses that you have maid for everyone, and the app will start to monitor how much and from who you have to get your money back.

**NOTE**: the server of WALLI is shut down, so it's not possible to use it. If you want the app online again, you have to put online the server code.
